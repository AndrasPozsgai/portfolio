  			<h1>Where is this place?</h1>
          <p><strong>Trolltunga</strong>(English: Troll tongue) is a rock formation situated about 1,100 metres (3,600 ft) above sea level in Ullensvang Municipality in Vestland county, Norway. The cliff juts horizontally out from the mountain, about 700 metres (2,300 ft) above the north side of the lake Ringedalsvatnet.[2]
  Popularity of the hike to Trolltunga and rock formation itself has exploded in recent years. The increased popularity has turned Trolltunga into a national icon and a major tourist attraction for the region. Until 2010, fewer than 800 people hiked to Trolltunga each year. In 2016 more than 80,000 people hiked[3] the 27-kilometre (17 mi) round-trip from the village of Skjeggedal, making it one of Norway's most popular hikes.[4]
  This is a very challenging hike, at least 10 hours on rough terrain. There are no shelters on the hike route and no places to buy supplies. However, there is a plan to build a lodge roughly halfway where hikers can rest. <p>

  		<h1>Geology</h1>
      <p>Geology
      The cliff is part of the Precambrian bedrock and was formed during the Ice Age, approximately <strong>10,000 years</strong> ago, when the edges of the glacier reached the cliff. The water from the glacier froze in the crevices of the mountain and eventually broke off large, angular blocks, which were later carried away with the glacier. Along the cliff itself, a gneiss, there continues to be deep cracks. The trail to Trolltunga also passes through the bedrock and washed slippery hillsides in the background also containing gneiss</p><br>
      <h1>Surrounding landscape</h1>
      <p>The cliff overlooks the valleys of the Hardanger region. The mountains surrounding the cliff reach <strong>heights of up to 1500 meters</strong>. Some of the hilltops have plains which are interspersed with lakes.</p>

<h1>Hiking trail</h1>
<p>
Near the parking area at Skjeggedal there is a funicular called <strong>Mågelibanen</strong> (it is not in operation). The trail to Trolltunga begins here, on the left side of the funicular. It is marked with red Ts painted in the terrain, and signs along the route that marks the distance left to Trolltunga and to the starting point at Skjeggedal.
For the first 1.5 kilometres (0.93 mi), up to the <strong>Måglitopp</strong>, the trail rises about 450 metres (1,480 ft). From here the track surfaces slightly out before it gets steep again, rising another 330 metres (1,080 ft) up from Gryteskaret to <strong>Trombåskåret.</strong> This section is the steepest part on this hike. But in recent years this section have been improved by Nepalese sherpas, making it easier to traverse.
After this 4-kilometre (2.5 mi) steep climb from the parking area, the next section slopes down towards Store Floren. The trail continues over <strong>Hesteflåene</strong> and the dried out river Endåno, before it gets steeper up to <strong>Endanuten</strong> and crosses the dried river to <strong>Tyssestrengene</strong>. From here the trail goes on past glacial potholes, then continues past <strong>Tysshøl</strong>, and finally approaches Trolltunga, about 13.5 kilometres (8.4 mi) from the starting point at Skjeggedal.

<p>Trolltunga sits at the edge to right of Tyssestrengene waterfall (as seen from the lake below). Photo by Axel Lindahl around 1890 before the waterfall was diverted to power production.
The route to Trolltunga goes through high mountain terrain with creeks, streams, boulders, mud puddles, marshes, and water at several spots on the hike.[citation needed]
From late-September to June the terrain is normally covered with ice and snow. After a hard winter it can be snow at Trolltunga even during the summer season.</p>

      <h1>Seasons and climate</h1>
<p>Trolltunga is accessible for experienced hikers and guided groups from mid-June to mid-September, depending on when the snow melts in the Spring. The season for guided trips with snowshoes or skis starts in March.
Trolltunga is located in a region with a mild and humid coastal climate. During summer and autumn the weather conditions often change quickly – from blue sky to wind, rain and dense fog. Check the weather forecast and ask locals about what kind of weather to expect before you go hiking.
Due to the long distance, hikers to Trolltunga need to start before 10:00 AM in the summer season[2] to get home before it gets dark and cold. In September it is recommended to start 8:00 AM at latest, since it gets darker earlier in the evening. </p>

<h1>Access</h1>
<p>rolltunga is located 17 kilometres (11 mi) from the town of Odda. The city of Bergen, is about 190 kilometres (120 mi) from the site via main roads.
The trailhead is located by a small parking area with toilet facilities at Skjeggedal, about 7 kilometres (4.3 mi) from Norwegian National Road 13 in Tyssedalen, near the dam at the end of Ringedalsvatnet. Parking costs 500 kr per day for the lower car park (approx. 62 USD[5] or 52 EUR[6]).
The hike from the parking area to Trolltunga and back again is a 27-kilometre (17 mi) round-trip distance with a 1,100-metre (3,600 ft) gain in elevation, and it takes approximately 10–12 hours, including breaks.</p>
